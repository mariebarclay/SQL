I'm having fun playing with a Kaggle dataset of data from the TV series Friends.

SELECT *
  FROM Friends
 LIMIT 10;

*/Although most true Friends fans know how many seasons there were in the series, I wasn't sure how many seasons the dataset contained information for.*/
SELECT MAX(season_number) 
  FROM Friends;

*/I was curious which characters out of the lead six had the most lines for the duration of the series
(no one should be shocked that it's Rachel quickly followed by Ross)*/
SELECT COUNT( * ) AS Total_Series_Line_Count,
       character
  FROM Friends
 WHERE character IN ('ross', 'joey', 'chandler', 'rachel', 'monica', 'phoebe') 
 GROUP BY character
 ORDER BY Total_Series_Line_Count desc;

*/So then I started wondering if Rachel and Ross took the lead in every season of the show - I broke down the line counts between the six lead characters even
further to look at lines per character, per season*/
SELECT COUNT( * ) AS Total_Line_Count_Per_Season,
       character,
       season_number
  FROM Friends
 WHERE character IN ('ross', 'joey', 'chandler', 'rachel', 'monica', 'phoebe') 
 GROUP BY character,
          season_number
 ORDER BY season_number asc;

*/I wanted to get even more detailed information about how the show spread lines (and presumably time spent in front of the camera) across the main six characters
in each episode of each season. Watch for my Tableau visualization of a timeline of the show Friends using only the breakdown of lines per character*/
SELECT COUNT( * ) AS Total_Line_Count_Per_Season_Per_Episode,
       character,
       season_number,
       episode_number
  FROM Friends
 WHERE character IN ('ross', 'joey', 'chandler', 'rachel', 'monica', 'phoebe') 
 GROUP BY character,
          season_number,
          episode_number
 ORDER BY season_number asc,
          episode_number asc;
